# ChargeKeeper

Battery care from the system tray — charge limits, a live battery gauge, and smart standby
control. Runs on ThinkPad laptops today (formerly published as **Lenovo Power Tray**); built to
support more hardware over time.

## Features

| Feature | Mechanism | Admin required |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Smart Charge** | Lenovo Power Manager RPC via `LenPower.dll` bridge | ✓ |
| **Smart Standby** | `LenovoSmartStandby` Windows service | ✓ |

## Running

The app manifest declares `requireAdministrator`.  A UAC prompt appears on the
first launch; auto-start via Task Scheduler is prompt-free on subsequent boots.

```powershell
# From an elevated terminal
dotnet run
# or right-click the compiled .exe → "Run as administrator"
```

### Command-line switches

| Switch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `/debug [on\|off]` | **Command, not a launch mode.** Turns **crash-dump capture** on or off (WER LocalDumps → `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper\dumps`), then exits — it never starts the tray. Off by default on release builds so a shipped app never quietly writes minidumps of itself into your profile; debug builds arm it regardless. |
| `--watchdog-relaunch` | Internal. Used by the `ChargeKeeper Watchdog` scheduled task's 5-minute probe — not meant to be typed by hand. |
| `--auto-relaunch` | Internal. Set when the app restarts itself after a GPU-reset teardown. |

`/debug` **persists** your choice as a marker file — `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper\crash-dumps-armed.marker`,
whose mere presence means "capture is on" — and applies it to the registry immediately, then the
process exits. It does not matter whether the tray app is already running: dump capture is governed
by a machine-wide key, so the change takes effect at once and nothing needs restarting.

The choice is a marker file rather than a setting in `settings.json` for a specific reason. The
running tray app keeps its settings in memory and rewrites the **whole** file whenever it saves, so a
flag stored there would be clobbered by a stale in-memory copy: arm capture with `/debug`, toggle any
preset in the tray, and the flag would be silently reset — leaving the next boot disarmed, which is
exactly the reboot-to-reproduce case the switch exists for. A marker file has no other writers, so
nothing the tray does can reach it. (It is the same pattern as the watchdog's own
`watchdog-hold.marker` next to it.)

```powershell
ChargeKeeper.exe /debug       # arm capture — survives reboots, sign-in autostart, and app restarts
ChargeKeeper.exe /debug off   # disarm again
```

Each invocation shows a UAC prompt (the app is `requireAdministrator`, and the registration lives in
**HKLM**) and reports what it did to `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper\app.log` — there is no console output,
because the exe is a windowed app.

Because the choice is stored rather than read from the command line, **every** way the app can start
— your own launch, the `ChargeKeeper AutoStart` logon task (which passes no arguments), a watchdog
probe, a self-heal relaunch — reads the same answer and re-asserts it. So dumps armed with `/debug`
stay armed across the reboot you need to reproduce the crash, and are not disarmed behind your back
by a probe five minutes later.

The HKLM key outlives the process, so "off" is not merely "don't arm": a run with capture disabled
actively **removes** the registration. One `/debug` session therefore cannot leave a machine dumping
forever.

> Disarming also removes the shared `...\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps` key when nothing else
> is registered under it. That key's mere presence turns dump collection on **machine-wide**, for
> every application — arming ours creates it as a side effect, so leaving it behind would have
> every other crashing app on the machine writing minidumps into your profile. It is left alone
> whenever another app is still registered there.

## Tray interactions

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Left-click | Toggle the battery dashboard popup |
| Right-click | Context menu with live-state toggles |
| Click away from popup | Auto-dismisses the dashboard |

### Context menu items
- **Smart Charge** — enable/disable the charge threshold  
- **Presets** — submenu of named threshold profiles: **Daily** (60–80 %) and **Travel** (80–100 %).
  Selecting one enables Smart Charge and applies those thresholds; the active preset is checkmarked  
- **⚡ Charge to 100 % once** — travel override: saves the current threshold, disables it so the
  battery charges fully, then auto-restores the saved threshold on the next Charging → full
  transition. While active the item reads **✕ Cancel charge override**; the override state persists
  across an app restart  
- **Smart Standby** — start/stop the `LenovoSmartStandby` service  
- **Numeric % icon** — toggle the tray icon between the arc gauge and a numeric percentage  
- **Launch at startup** — add/remove the Task Scheduler auto-start entry  
- **Exit**

## Dashboard popup
Appears bottom-right above the taskbar.  Closes on focus loss.  Refreshes every 5 s.

- Circular arc gauge: charge %, coloured on a continuous scale that depends on the power state —
  on battery it runs ember → terracotta → sage → lavender, while charging it runs steel blue →
  lavender, and connected but not charging it runs steel blue → orchid, so a pack held high on
  mains reads differently from one still filling
- Amber tick marks on the arc at the Smart Charge start% and stop% positions (visible when Smart
  Charge is enabled with valid thresholds)
- Power source (AC / Battery) and charge/drain rate in watts
- **TIME stat** — time-to-full when charging, time-remaining when discharging; shows **—** when the
  charge rate is negligible
- **Battery % history graph** — a graph of battery level over a selectable time span, one fixed
  accent per series rather than the gauge's level-dependent colour, persisted across restarts
- **Smart Charge badge** — shows current thresholds; expands to reveal Start/Stop sliders when
  Smart Charge is enabled. Sliders are constrained (≥ 5% gap); **Apply** writes the new thresholds
  immediately via `LenSetChargeThreshold`
- **Smart Standby badge** — shows service running state
- **Keep Awake badge** — with no session it reads *normal sleep settings*; with one running it shows
  how much of the session is left, then a tappable phrase reading *screen stays on* or *screen
  sleeps*. Tapping the phrase switches the screen hold and re-applies it to the session already
  running, so the change takes effect without ending and restarting it. Holding the screen on while
  discharging is allowed rather than refused: the badge and the phrase turn amber and the line ends
  *, on battery*, so the cost is shown instead of blocked. The tray tooltip carries the same line
  while a session runs
- **Settings expander** — a collapsible section for app options (see [Settings](#settings))

The tray icon is a live battery-level arc (same colour scheme as the gauge), updated on every
`Battery.ReportUpdated` event. It can be switched to a **numeric percentage** instead of the arc
via the **Numeric % icon** tray toggle or the dashboard Settings.

A **custom low-battery warning** raises a toast when the battery drops to a configurable % while
discharging. It has 5 % hysteresis so it won't repeat-fire as the level hovers around the threshold.
Configured in Settings (on/off toggle + threshold).

## Settings

Settings persist to `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper\settings.json` — a roaming, human-readable JSON file.
The MQTT broker block is the one exception: it lives beside it in `mqtt.json`, together with
`mqtt-discovery.json`, which records what has actually been put on the broker.

> **Upgrading from Lenovo Power Tray?** On first launch the app automatically moves the old
> `%AppData%\LenovoPowerTray` folder to `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper`, so settings and battery history
> carry over.

The dashboard's collapsible **Settings** expander exposes:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Low-battery warning** | On/off toggle + threshold % for the discharge toast (5 % hysteresis) |
| **Startup delay** | Seconds to wait before the app initialises at sign-in — keeps it off the critical path when many elevated apps start at once |
| **Tray icon style** | Arc gauge, Numeric % or Battery fill |
| **Also show percentage** | A second, display-only tray icon carrying the charge level as a number. Unavailable while Numeric % is the style, which already shows it. Windows files a new tray icon behind the overflow chevron, so drag it out once to keep it on the taskbar |
| **Sleep if the computer reaches a temperature** | Ends a lid-close wait early and sleeps the computer once it reaches the chosen temperature, ahead of the delay and the battery target. Off by default, and offered only where the computer exposes a reading that has been shown to be trustworthy. Sleep, never shutdown; what happened is said at the next wake |
| **Show icons in main tray (experimental)** | Asks Windows to keep both icons on the taskbar rather than behind the overflow chevron. Off by default. Experimental because Windows offers no supported way to do it: on a version that stores the setting differently it does nothing at all, and switching it off puts back whatever was there before |

It also offers:

- **Export… / Import…** — back up or load the settings file. These use classic Win32 file dialogs
  because the app runs elevated, where the WinRT pickers are unreliable
- **Open file** — reveals `settings.json` in Explorer

The file is portable by copy across machines. Automatic cloud sync is not yet implemented (a planned
future option).

### App diagnostics

The **App diagnostics** page in the Settings window carries the self-measurement graph: what
ChargeKeeper itself is costing, plotted live.

- **Off by default, and off means nothing is scheduled.** No timer runs and no processor time goes
  to measuring while the switch is off.
- **Sampling rate**, 10 Hz down to 0.1 Hz, governs the processor line only. Memory, handles and
  threads are read once a second whatever the rate says, because they cost a snapshot of every
  process on the machine while reading processor time does not. At the slowest rate the memory line
  is therefore the denser of the two; the legend names each line's own rate.
- **The log** is `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper\performance-history.csv`, separate from `app.log` and from
  the battery histories, and on the same retention mechanism as the battery level history: rows past
  the retention age are dropped, and because the rate is adjustable this file also carries a row cap.

## Building

```powershell
dotnet build -c Release
```

Output: `bin\Release\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0\win-x64\`

## Installing & updating

End users install by running `ChargeKeeper-Setup.exe` from the GitHub releases. The installer is a
**per-user Inno Setup** package — it installs to `%LocalAppData%` with **no admin prompt**, adds a
Start-menu shortcut, and offers one checkbox: **"Run at startup"**.

Updates come from GitHub Releases. **Check for updates** starts the same check from two places — the
tray menu, and the About page in Settings, beside the running version and **What's new**. The app
also asks by itself 30 seconds after start and once every 24 hours while it runs. A downloaded
installer is refused unless its digest is intact, a signature is present and the signer is
`CN=ZeroZero Software`.

An accepted update installs **unattended** — no wizard, no page to advance. The
app closes, the installer runs showing a progress window only, and the app starts again on the new
version and reports what changed. It does not wait on the installer: waiting would hold the very
files the installer replaces. An update that does not complete is stated the next time the app
starts, alongside the installer's own log at `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper\update-install.log`.

An installer carrying the older `ChargeKeeper AutoUpdate` logon task removes it on install: that task
ran `winget upgrade`, and the package is not in a winget source.

The app stays `requireAdministrator`, so it elevates only at runtime. The single place the installer
elevates is when "Run at startup" is ticked, to register a `RunLevel=Highest` logon task
(`ChargeKeeper AutoStart`) — the same task the in-app "Launch at startup" toggle manages.

Upgrading over an existing **Lenovo Power Tray** install works in place: the installer closes the
old `LenovoTray.exe`, deletes its stale binaries and scheduled tasks, and keeps the recorded
install folder. Note that the winget package identity changed with the rename, so winget users
run `winget install 0z00z0.ChargeKeeper` once; the old package ID will not upgrade across the rename.

Building and releasing the installer (needs `winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup`) is documented in
**[installer/README.md](installer/README.md)**:

```powershell
cd installer
.\build-installer.ps1              # auto-bumps patch (e.g. 1.2.0 → 1.2.1)
.\build-installer.ps1 -Version 1.3.0   # explicit override
```

## Code signing

The app is Authenticode-signed so the UAC elevation prompt shows a verified
publisher (`ZeroZero Software`) instead of *"Unknown Publisher"*.

**One-time setup** — create and trust a self-signed code-signing certificate:

```powershell
.\scripts\sign.ps1 -Setup
```

This creates a 5-year cert in `Cert:\CurrentUser\My` and registers it as a trusted
root + trusted publisher for the current user (no admin required).

**Signing happens automatically** on every `Release` build via the `SignOutput`
MSBuild target, which calls `scripts\sign.ps1`. To sign manually:

```powershell
.\scripts\sign.ps1                                   # signs the latest Release exe
.\scripts\sign.ps1 -Path path\to\ChargeKeeper.exe    # sign a specific file
```

Verify a signature:

```powershell
Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\bin\Release\net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0\win-x64\ChargeKeeper.exe
```

**Notes**
- The certificate's private key lives only in the Windows cert store — no `.pfx`
  is written to the project folder, so nothing secret is committed.
- To use a real CA-issued certificate, import it into `Cert:\CurrentUser\My` with
  subject `CN=ZeroZero Software` (or pass `-Subject` to `scripts\sign.ps1`); signing picks it up
  by subject automatically — no other change needed.
- A self-signed cert is trusted only on machines where `-Setup` has been run.
  Other machines will still show "Unknown Publisher" unless the public cert is
  imported into their trusted stores.

## Auto-start

`HKCU\Run` entries for elevated apps trigger a UAC prompt on every boot.
`TaskSchedulerHelper` instead creates a Task Scheduler logon-trigger task with
`RunLevel = Highest` — elevated, prompt-free.

## Smart Charge (battery charge threshold)

### Prerequisite: Lenovo Power Management Driver

Smart Charge requires the **Lenovo Power Management Driver** (Windows service `PWMGR`,
"Lenovo Power and Battery"). It ships with the ThinkPad hardware driver package and is
almost certainly already present if the laptop has ever had a full driver installation.

To verify (elevated PowerShell): `Get-Service -Name PWMGR -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`

If the service is missing, download **"Power Management Driver for Windows 10 and 11
(64-bit)"** from [Lenovo Support](https://support.lenovo.com/) for your model. Without
it, Smart Charge shows as **Unavailable** — the rest of the app works fine.

### How Smart Charge works

ThinkPad firmware does **not** expose the battery charge threshold through the
Lenovo BIOS WMI provider (`Lenovo_BiosSetting`) — that class has no charge-threshold
key on these machines. The threshold is owned by the **Lenovo Power Manager**, which
Lenovo Vantage drives over a local-RPC (`ncalrpc`) interface.

`ChargeThresholdService` reaches it through a small native bridge, **`LenPower.dll`**
(sources in `native/`), which marshals the Power Manager's RPC calls via a
MIDL-generated client stub. The managed side P/Invokes two flat exports:

- `LenGetChargeThreshold(battery, out capable, out enabled, out start, out stop)`
- `LenSetChargeThreshold(battery, start, stop)`  (start = stop = 0 disables, i.e. charges to 100 %)

### Building the native bridge

`LenPower.dll` is **not** built by `dotnet build`; build it once with the VC++
toolset (any edition with "Desktop development with C++"):

```powershell
cd native
.\build.cmd        # runs MIDL + cl, emits LenPower.dll
```

The csproj copies `native\LenPower.dll` next to the app on build. To verify the
RPC path against your hardware, run (from an **elevated** shell):

```powershell
cd native
.\test-read.ps1    # prints the live capable/enabled/start/stop values
```

If the dashboard shows *"Unavailable"*, the bridge couldn't reach the Power Manager
(DLL missing, driver not installed, or not running elevated); *"Not supported"* means
the firmware reported the battery as not threshold-capable.

## Design notes

- **No public API surface** — in the app project all service/feature types are
  `internal`; the only `public` class is `App`, required by the WinUI framework.
  The `Vendors/*` projects expose only their contract types (interfaces + the
  module class) as `public` — implementations stay `internal`.
- **Feature abstraction** — the three menu toggles implement `IToggleFeature`
  (`Name` / `IsAvailable` / `IsEnabled` / `SetEnabled`). `IsAvailable` distinguishes
  "hardware not capable" from "feature off", so `TrayMenu` can grey out incapable items
  rather than showing them as unchecked. `SetEnabled` returns `bool` to propagate write
  failures. `TrayMenu` builds and refreshes all items in a single loop.
- **UI thread safety** — toggle writes and dashboard badge reads all run on background
  threads via `Task.Run` (RPC and service calls can block for seconds); results are
  marshalled back to the UI thread with `DispatcherQueue.TryEnqueue`.
- **Vendor split** — everything Lenovo-specific lives in its own project
  (`Vendors/Lenovo`) behind the vendor-neutral interfaces in `Vendors/Abstractions`,
  so another vendor (e.g. HP) is a new project plus one line in `VendorCatalog`.
  The app keeps thin static facades (`ChargeThresholdService`, `StandbyService`)
  so call sites are unchanged from before the split.
- **Native interop** — Smart Charge is the one feature that can't be done from
  managed code or WMI; it goes through `LenPower.dll` (see `native/`). The managed
  provider fails soft (`Read()` → `null`) if the bridge or driver is absent, so
  the rest of the app works on non-Lenovo hardware.
- **DPI** — the app is declared `PerMonitorV2`-aware. `AppWindow.Resize/Move` work
  in physical pixels while XAML lays out in DIPs, so the popup is sized and placed
  using the work area **and** DPI scale of the monitor under the cursor
  (`NativeMethods.GetCursorMonitorMetrics`) — correct on mixed-DPI multi-monitor setups.
