# ChargeKeeper

**Battery care from the system tray** — charge limits, a live battery gauge, and smart standby
control. ChargeKeeper runs on Lenovo ThinkPads (via the Lenovo Power Management Driver) and on
HP's commercial laptops (via HP's BIOS WMI interface), and is built to support more hardware
over time.

> Formerly published as **Lenovo Power Tray**. See
> [Upgrading from Lenovo Power Tray](#upgrading-from-lenovo-power-tray).

Two power features, without opening the slow Lenovo Vantage app:

- **Smart Charge** — battery charge threshold. On Lenovo, via the Lenovo Power Manager local-RPC
  interface (the same one Lenovo Vantage uses), through a small native bridge (`LenPower.dll`).
  On HP, via the `root\HP\InstrumentedBIOS` WMI namespace — no native component needed.
- **Smart Standby** — Modern Standby scheduling, via the `LenovoSmartStandby` Windows service.
  Lenovo only.

Left-click the tray icon for a battery dashboard (arc gauge with live % and charge-rate, threshold
tick markers, adjustable start/stop sliders); right-click for quick toggles, presets, and
**Settings…** (opens the full configuration window). The tray icon itself shows a live
battery-level arc, coloured on a continuous scale that follows both the level and the power state —
on battery, charging, or connected and holding — or, optionally, the battery percentage as a
number. An exclamation mark in place of a reading means start-up failed: the battery is not being
watched and no battery warnings will be given until the application is restarted. Hovering the icon
says the same in words, and `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper\app.log` carries the reason.

### Features

- **Threshold presets** — named charging profiles (**Daily** 60–80%, **Travel** 80–100%), added/
  renamed/deleted from the **Settings** window's Smart Charge section, quick-applied from the tray
  right-click **Presets** submenu.
- **Charge to 100% once (travel override)** — a tray menu item that temporarily lifts the charge
  threshold for one cycle, then auto-restores it once the battery reaches full. Survives an app
  restart mid-charge.
- **Network-aware presets** — automatically apply a preset when the detected network location
  (adapter MAC + IP subnet — never Wi-Fi network name) changes, e.g. a different preset at the
  office dock vs. on the road. Configured under **Network profiles** in the Settings window's
  Smart Charge section, next to the presets they select.
- **Custom low-battery warning** — a toast at a user-set battery % while discharging (Settings
  window → Notifications).
- **Time remaining / time to full** — the dashboard shows estimated time-to-full (charging) or
  time-remaining (discharging).
- **Battery % history graph** — a persistent graph of recent battery level in the dashboard,
  with selectable time scales.
- **Configurable startup delay** — wait N seconds before the app initialises at sign-in (Settings
  window → General).
- **Three tray icon styles** — the arc gauge, the reading as a number, or a battery whose interior
  fills to the level (Settings window → General).
- **Also show percentage** — a second, display-only tray icon carrying the charge level as a number
  beside whichever style the main icon uses. Off by default, and unavailable while the main style is
  already the number.
- **Show icons in main tray (experimental)** — asks Windows to keep both tray icons on the taskbar
  rather than behind the overflow chevron. Off by default, reversible, and does nothing at all on a
  Windows that keeps the setting somewhere else.
- **Settings window** — a proper titled window (tray icon → **Settings…**) with a General/Smart
  Charge/Notifications/MQTT/About sidebar, replacing the old nested tray submenus. Settings are
  stored as human-readable JSON at `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper\settings.json`
  (tray icon → **Open settings folder**); an out-of-band edit to that file can be picked up without
  restarting via tray icon → **Reload settings from file**. Settings are portable across machines by
  copying this file; automatic cloud sync is not yet implemented.
  The file opens with a `version` key and then one object per Settings page, in the order the pages
  run and the rows appear, so a setting is found where it sits on screen. A file written before the
  grouping — a flat list of keys, no `version` — is read as it stands and rewritten grouped on the
  next save, with the original kept beside it as `settings.json.pre-grouping-backup-<timestamp>`.

## Install

Download the installer from the
[latest release](https://github.com/0z00z0/ChargeKeeper/releases/latest) and run it. The asset is
named `ChargeKeeper-Setup-<version>.exe` — `ChargeKeeper-Setup-1.28.0.exe` for release v1.28.0. The
installer is **per-user — no admin needed to install** — and offers one option:

- **Run at startup** — auto-starts the app at sign-in. Ticking it asks for elevation once, to
  register a prompt-free elevated logon task.

Updates come from GitHub Releases. The app checks 30 seconds after start and once a day after that,
and the tray menu's **Check for updates** asks on demand. A downloaded installer is verified before
it is launched: intact digest, a present signature, and the signer `CN=ZeroZero Software`.

The app itself shows a UAC prompt when it launches, since changing the charge threshold / standby
service requires administrator rights.

### Expect a SmartScreen warning on a first install

The installer is Authenticode-signed with a **self-issued certificate** — subject and issuer are
both `CN=ZeroZero Software` — rather than one chaining to a commercial certificate authority. A
machine that has never seen that certificate treats the publisher as untrusted, so a first install
shows two warnings, both expected:

- SmartScreen's **"Windows protected your PC"** block — **More info → Run anyway** to continue;
- an elevation prompt naming an **unknown publisher**.

Because the warning appears either way, it cannot distinguish a genuine download from a tampered
one. Two things can:

- **The signature.** Right-click the installer → **Properties** → **Digital Signatures**. A genuine
  build is signed by `CN=ZeroZero Software` and carries a timestamp. No signature, or a different
  signer, means the file is not the published build.
- **The hash.** Every release publishes the installer's SHA256. Compare it against the downloaded
  file before running it.

### Installing from the winget manifests

`winget install 0z00z0.ChargeKeeper` finds nothing: the package is not in `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.
Until it is accepted there (tracked as
[issue #15](https://github.com/0z00z0/ChargeKeeper/issues/15)), the interim route is a local
manifest install. Every release ships three manifest files as assets —
`0z00z0.ChargeKeeper.yaml`, `0z00z0.ChargeKeeper.installer.yaml` and
`0z00z0.ChargeKeeper.locale.en-GB.yaml`. Download all three into one folder, then:

```powershell
winget settings --enable LocalManifestFiles   # one-time
winget install --manifest <folder>
```

The manifests name the release's own installer asset and carry its SHA256, so winget verifies what
it downloads.

## Upgrading from Lenovo Power Tray

ChargeKeeper is the same app under a new name. Upgrading is safe and mostly automatic:

- **Settings and battery history migrate automatically.** On first launch, ChargeKeeper moves your
  old `%AppData%\LenovoPowerTray` folder to `%AppData%\ChargeKeeper` — settings, presets, and the
  battery history graph all carry over.
- **The installer cleans up after the old version.** Running the ChargeKeeper installer over an
  existing Lenovo Power Tray install closes the old app, removes its old binaries and scheduled
  tasks, and upgrades in place.
- **winget is not an upgrade route.** The package identity changed with the rename, and the new
  identity is not in `microsoft/winget-pkgs`, so `winget upgrade` has nothing to find. Take the
  direct download from the [latest release](https://github.com/0z00z0/ChargeKeeper/releases/latest)
  instead, or use the release's winget manifests as described under
  [Installing from the winget manifests](#installing-from-the-winget-manifests).

## Requirements

- Windows 10 (1809+) / Windows 11
- A supported laptop — the app picks its vendor module automatically at startup:

  | Vendor | Models | Charge limit | Smart Standby |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | **Lenovo** | ThinkPad (built and tested on an X1 Yoga Gen 7) | Adjustable start/stop % | Yes |
  | **HP** | Commercial lines — EliteBook, ProBook, ZBook (tested on an EliteBook 840 G8) | Fixed cap only, see below | No |

  HP's consumer models (Pavilion, Envy) do **not** ship the BIOS WMI interface and are not
  supported. Support for other vendors is planned.
- **Administrator rights** — both features require elevation (the app manifest declares
  `requireAdministrator`)

### HP: what works and what doesn't

HP's firmware has no numeric charge threshold. It exposes a single **Battery Health Manager**
setting with three coarse modes, so ChargeKeeper can turn limiting on or off but cannot set an
arbitrary percentage — the dashboard hides the range picker on HP and shows the fixed cap
(around 80%) instead.

**Windows will still show 100%, and that is correct.** HP's cap works by *lowering the battery's
reported full-charge capacity*, not by stopping the charge early — so a capped battery reads as
100% of a deliberately reduced maximum. Verified on an EliteBook 840 G8: full-charge capacity
42,377 mWh against a design capacity of 53,015 mWh, i.e. **79.93%** where the target is 80.00%.

To check whether the cap is active on your own machine, compare the two capacities rather than
looking at the percentage:

```powershell
powercfg /batteryreport /output "$env:TEMP\br.xml" /XML
([xml](Get-Content "$env:TEMP\br.xml")).BatteryReport.Batteries.Battery |
    ForEach-Object { "{0:N2}% of design" -f ($_.FullChargeCapacity / $_.DesignCapacity * 100) }
```

Two further caveats:

- **Changes apply after a restart.** HP does not action battery BIOS settings immediately.
- **HP's own adaptive logic may override the setting.** "Adaptive Battery Optimizer" is a
  separate, read-only BIOS setting that cannot be turned off through WMI. Where it is active,
  HP's firmware decides for itself when to cap.

Smart Standby is Lenovo-only — HP ships no equivalent, so the toggle is not shown.

### Smart Charge prerequisite — Lenovo Power Management Driver

Smart Charge talks directly to the **Lenovo Power Management Driver** (Windows service `PWMGR`,
"Lenovo Power and Battery") — the same service Lenovo Vantage uses under the hood.

**You do not need Lenovo Vantage.** You do need the driver.

It ships as part of the ThinkPad hardware driver package. If your laptop originally shipped with
Windows (or has had a full driver installation) it is almost certainly already present.

To check — run in an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Service -Name PWMGR -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

If the service appears (`Running` or `Stopped`), Smart Charge will work. If nothing is returned,
install the driver:

1. Go to your model's driver page on [Lenovo Support](https://support.lenovo.com/) (search your
   model name / serial number, or use
   [PC Support Auto-Detect](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht003029)).
2. Select **Drivers & Software → category Power Management**.
3. Download and run **"Power Management Driver for Windows 10 and 11 (64-bit)"**.

If the driver is absent, Smart Charge shows as **Unavailable** in the tray and dashboard — the
rest of the app (Smart Standby, auto-start, battery gauge) works fine without it.

### Build prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK
- A C++ toolset (Visual Studio / Build Tools with **"Desktop development with C++"**) to build the
  native Smart Charge bridge (`native/`) — only needed once
- A sibling clone of [0z0-shared](https://github.com/0z00z0/0z0-shared) (shared ZeroZero
  Software components — see [Shared components](#shared-components) below)

## Build from source

```powershell
# 0. Clone this repo AND the shared components library as siblings (the csproj references
#    ..\0z0-shared\src\ZeroZero.Brand.WinUI by relative path).
git clone https://github.com/0z00z0/ChargeKeeper.git
git clone https://github.com/0z00z0/0z0-shared.git
cd ChargeKeeper

# 1. Build the native Smart Charge bridge (LenPower.dll). One-time, needs the C++ toolset.
#    build.cmd locates MSVC + MIDL automatically (incl. VS 2026 Insiders).
cd native
.\build.cmd
cd ..

# 2. Build the app (Release output is Authenticode-signed if a cert is set up — see USAGE.md).
#    The csproj copies native\LenPower.dll next to the executable.
dotnet build -c Release

# 3. Run elevated
dotnet run
# or right-click the compiled ChargeKeeper.exe → "Run as administrator"
```

> Smart Standby, the dashboard, and auto-start work without the native bridge. If `LenPower.dll`
> is missing, Smart Charge simply shows as **Unavailable** rather than breaking the app.

A UAC prompt appears on first launch. Enable **Launch at startup** from the right-click menu to
auto-start prompt-free on subsequent boots (via a Task Scheduler logon task).

See **[USAGE.md](USAGE.md)** for full usage, code-signing, troubleshooting, and architecture notes.

## Building the installer

The per-user installer is built with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) and published
as a GitHub release asset, alongside the winget manifests that describe it. See
**[installer/README.md](installer/README.md)** for the full release workflow:

```powershell
winget install JRSoftware.InnoSetup     # one-time
cd installer
.\build-installer.ps1              # auto-bumps patch (or pass -Version 1.2.0 explicitly)
```

## External libraries

The app targets the Microsoft stack (.NET, Windows App SDK / WinUI 3, `System.*` runtime
packages). The only **non-Microsoft** dependencies are:

## MQTT

ChargeKeeper can publish its battery, charge and settings surface to an MQTT broker. When enabled it
connects to your broker and announces a single **ChargeKeeper** device with forty-nine entities — battery
level and state, charge power, on-AC, battery health and the raw capacities, the system temperature
and its recommended maximum where a trustworthy reading exists, the Smart Charge limit
and preset, Keep Awake, lid handling with both of its sleep conditions, the warning thresholds, the
detected network and the app's own diagnostics. An availability topic, with a Last-Will, marks the
device offline if the app stops.

Each entity has **its own bare topic carrying a plain value** — no JSON payload and no templates — so
a shell script or a flow engine reads one with no parsing. Twenty-three of them take commands, and a
value the app will not act on is refused with a reason rather than silently clamped.

The entities are announced with the **Home Assistant MQTT Discovery** convention — an openly
published spec that some MQTT consumers follow and others ignore. [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
itself therefore picks the device up with no YAML, and so does any other consumer implementing the
same convention; one that does not can still subscribe to the state topics directly. Device-based
discovery sets the receiver floor at Home Assistant **2024.11.0**.

It is **off by default** and never touches the network until you both enable it and set a broker
host. Configure it from the tray icon → **Settings…** → **MQTT**: the master switch, the device name
and the publish-group toggles apply immediately, and the broker host, port, transport, encryption,
username, password and discovery prefix commit together behind an **Apply** button, taking effect
only when it is pressed rather than while typing. The password is never logged and never leaves the
machine except to the broker it authenticates to.

### Where the settings live

The broker block lives in **`%AppData%\ChargeKeeper\mqtt.json`**, beside `settings.json` rather than
inside it (tray icon → **Open settings folder**). An installation upgrading from an earlier version
has its broker block moved there automatically, keeping the device id — so every existing entity
carries over with its name, area, labels and automations intact.

```jsonc
{
  "Enabled": true,
  "Host": "homeassistant.local",   // or the broker IP
  "Port": 1883,                    // or null to find the port by trying the broker
  "Username": "your-mqtt-user",
  "Password": "your-mqtt-password", // stored locally, same as any MQTT client
  "TransportMode": "Auto",          // Auto | Tcp | WebSocket
  "EncryptionMode": "Auto",         // Auto (encrypted first, then plain) | On | Off
  "DeviceId": "",                   // empty = derived from the machine name
  "DeviceName": "",                 // empty = "ChargeKeeper (<machine name>)"
  "DiscoveryPrefix": "homeassistant", // the prefix your consumer discovers on
  "Groups": { "app_diagnostics": true } // per-group switches; an absent key takes its own default
}
```

`mqtt-discovery.json` sits beside it. That is a record of what was actually put on the broker, not a
setting: it is what lets an entity removed while the app was closed be cleaned up on the next
connect, and what stops a one-off retirement being replayed on every start.

## Shared components

The **About** window comes from [0z0-shared](https://github.com/0z00z0/0z0-shared)
(`ZeroZero.Brand.WinUI.BrandAboutWindow`, MIT) — the shared components library used across ZeroZero
Software apps, referenced as a sibling-folder `ProjectReference` (no NuGet package yet). How the
integration works:

- The app supplies data only (`BrandAboutOptions` → `AboutInfo`: name, version, description, repo
  URL, external-library credits); the library owns all chrome, layout, and the brand typeface.
- `OnCheckForUpdates` (`Func<Task<bool>>`) plugs the app's own update flow into the window's
  *Check for Updates* button. ChargeKeeper always returns `false` — it downloads the installer on a
  background task and exits itself when ready, so the window never needs to drive the exit
  (`OnBeforeExit` is therefore left unset).
The **MQTT module** comes from the same repository — `ZeroZero.Mqtt` for the protocol,
`ZeroZero.Mqtt.Discovery` for the entity and document layer, and `ZeroZero.Mqtt.WinUI` for the
settings panel the MQTT page hosts. ChargeKeeper supplies the topic root, the forty-nine entity
declarations, the seven publish groups and the copy saying what it publishes; everything else —
the endpoint sweep, the encryption model, the retained document, the eviction ledger and every
protocol sentence in the panel — belongs to the module.

The **build kit** comes from the same repository and is not a reference at all: `Directory.Build.props`,
`Directory.Build.targets` and `Directory.Packages.props` at the repository root each import one of
its files from the sibling checkout, and `ChargeKeeper.csproj` imports the WinUI application block.
It decides the language settings, the studio identity, the signing step and every third-party
package version, so **no `PackageReference` in this repository carries a `Version` attribute** —
a version there fails the build. A package the family shares moves in the kit's own pin file; one
only ChargeKeeper uses moves in `Directory.Packages.props` here.

### Resolving the shared library

**Resolution:** pinned to the commit named in `.github/0z0-shared-ref`. It carries the 0.7.0 release
of every component in the library, plus the fixes merged after it — 2026-09-03.

Both workflows read that one file and check the sibling clone out at the commit it names, so a
release builds against exactly what CI tested, a release rebuilds identically later, and a change
merged in 0z0-shared cannot reach a build here without the pin being bumped. The pin is a commit
rather than a tag or branch name, so it cannot move under a build.

A local build compiles against the live sibling working tree instead of the pin, so a green local
build proves nothing about it. Build warning `ZZ0001` reports the difference whenever the sibling
clone sits at another commit — a warning, not an error, so local work against a newer library is
not blocked. Adopting anything new from the shared library means bumping the pin in the same
change; without it CI fails with CS0234.

**Bump the pin in the same change that adopts something new.** Expect `ZZ0001` in the meantime on a
machine whose sibling clone has moved past the pin.

**Notice before a structural change.** 0z0-shared gives notice before renaming or relocating
anything reachable from ChargeKeeper's source reference. On notice, build against the proposed shape,
report back what breaks here, and expect the change to land only after that report. Two structural
changes stand proposed and undecided: moving the info bubble control out of `ZeroZero.Brand.WinUI`,
and introducing a layer beneath that assembly. The first reaches further into this repository — the
info bubble sits on several Settings pages, and the current release adds another instance of it — so
it is the one to check use site by use site when notice arrives.

## Credits & acknowledgements

Smart Charge is the hard part: ThinkPad firmware does **not** expose the battery charge threshold
through WMI, so it has to be driven over the Lenovo Power Manager's local-RPC interface — the same
one Lenovo Vantage uses.

- **[LenPwrCtl](https://github.com/alandau/LenPwrCtl)** by **alandau** (MIT) — the Power Manager RPC
  interface in [`native/pwrmgr.idl`](native/pwrmgr.idl) (endpoint, context handles, and the
  `LpcGetChargeThreshold` / `LpcSetChargeThreshold` procedure layout) was **reverse-engineered by
  this project** and is reused here under its MIT licence. This app would not be possible without it.
  Huge thanks. 🙏

The `native/` bridge (`lenpower.c`) is a thin wrapper that exposes two flat exports over that
interface for the managed app to P/Invoke; the interface definition itself is alandau's work.
