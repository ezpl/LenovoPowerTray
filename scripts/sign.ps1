.SYNOPSIS
    Code-signs ChargeKeeper.exe with a self-signed certificate.

.DESCRIPTION
    Run once with -Setup to create a self-signed code-signing certificate in the
    current user's store and register it as a trusted root + trusted publisher,
    so Windows treats the signature as valid (no "Unknown Publisher" UAC banner).

    Without -Setup, the script signs the target executable using the existing
    certificate. This mode is invoked automatically by the Release build (see the
    SignOutput target in ChargeKeeper.csproj) and exits 0 if no certificate is found,
    so it never breaks a build.

    The signing itself belongs to the build kit's Sign-Executable.ps1 in the sibling
    0z0-shared checkout. It reads the file back off disk and refuses a signature that
    arrived without a timestamp (ZZS013) — an outcome Set-AuthenticodeSignature reports
    as Valid, and one that stops verifying the day the certificate expires.

    To use a real CA-issued certificate instead, import it into Cert:\CurrentUser\My
    with the same -Subject and skip -Setup; signing picks it up by subject name.

    NOTE: The same certificate (CN=ZeroZero Software) is shared with the sibling
    HyperVManagerTray project. Running -Setup only once (on either project) is sufficient.

.EXAMPLE
    .\sign.ps1 -Setup          # one-time: create + trust the certificate
    .\sign.ps1                 # sign the latest Release build
#>
