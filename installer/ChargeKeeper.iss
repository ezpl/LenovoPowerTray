; With it left at the default, Inno reads {app} straight from the AppId-recorded uninstall key and

; Turning it off hands the choice to ResolveInstallDir in [Code], which returns the recorded
; directory UNCHANGED unless its final component is the retired name. So a directory the user chose
; for themselves is still honoured; only the retired one is replaced.

; #60: high-contrast setup icon, rendered PER FRAME SIZE. SetupIconFile is not merely the wizard's
; title-bar icon — it is Setup.exe's OWN file icon, so it lands on two opposite surfaces: Inno's
; LIGHT wizard title bar (16 px, #F3F3F3) and DARK Explorer / desktop / taskbar (32 px+, #202020 on
; Win11 dark). No single palette serves both: the dense "ink" tones score 11.87:1 on light but
; 1.24:1 on dark (invisible), while a dark-plated glyph scores 6.36:1 on dark but reads as an ugly
; box on light chrome. So the frames split by the size each surface asks for — 16 px stays ink on
; transparent for the wizard bar; 32 px and up are plated (dark #0e1620 square, light product
; glyph) for Explorer. Accepted cost: Explorer's "Small icons" view can request 16 px, where the
; ink glyph is weak on dark — the wizard's 16 px on light is guaranteed on every run, that view
; mode is optional, so we serve the certain case. Built by scripts\make-appicon.ps1 -HighContrast.

; SINGLE high-res (300 %) hero bitmap rather than a per-DPI comma list. On a mixed-DPI setup
; (100 % external primary + 175 % laptop panel) Inno picks the bitmap for the monitor Setup
; STARTS on, then UPSCALES it when shown on a higher-DPI monitor — that upscale is what made
; the banner text blurry. One 300 % bitmap means Inno can only ever DOWNSCALE (crisp at every
; scaling factor 100–300 %). Aspect matches Inno's image area (164:314 and 55:58) so the
; downscale is uniform. See make-wizard-images.ps1 for the full rationale.

; Set EXPLICITLY, not left to the default: with the old 5-variant lists Inno picked a bitmap that
; already matched the image area, so stretching was immaterial. With one 300 % hero the banner
; depends on it entirely — WizardImageStretch=no would centre the 492x942 bitmap at natural size in
; the 164x314 area and show roughly its middle ninth, cropping the [Ø] mark, "ZeroZero Software"
; and the "ChargeKeeper" wordmark straight off. Nothing renders these BMPs in CI, so only a manual
; look at a signed installer would ever catch that.
WizardImageStretch=yes
; Restart Manager is NOT used to close the running app (issue #119). Setup runs unelevated
; (PrivilegesRequired=lowest) while ChargeKeeper.exe is requireAdministrator, so Restart Manager
; cannot terminate it: it logs "Can use RestartManager to avoid reboot? No (1: Permission Denied)"
; and Setup gives up BEFORE the install phase — no program files and no uninstall key are written,
; so an upgrade attempted while the app is running silently does nothing at all.
; PrepareToInstall in [Code] stops the app itself, through an elevated taskkill, at the step that
; runs just before Setup's own in-use check would have.
CloseApplications=no
; Immaterial while CloseApplications=no (Setup only restarts what it closed), but kept explicit:
; the app is requireAdministrator, so Setup must never relaunch it — LaunchApp in [Code] owns the

; has never existed on any install, so the shortcut silently showed a blank/generic icon once
; Explorer's icon cache stopped masking it.
; The reason is the PATH, not the file: the csproj ships Assets\AppIcon.ico with
; CopyToOutputDirectory=PreserveNewest, so it DOES publish — but to "Assets\AppIcon.ico", and
; [Files] copies {#PublishDir}\* with recursesubdirs, preserving that folder. The installed icon
; is therefore "{app}\Assets\AppIcon.ico", never "{app}\AppIcon.ico". (An earlier version of this
; comment claimed the file never publishes at all. It was wrong then and is wrong twice over now —
; even without CopyToOutputDirectory the WinUI targets copy globbed Content to the output anyway.)
; So: don't "fix" this by pointing IconFilename at {app}\AppIcon.ico after checking the csproj and

; at the exe stays correct and needs no [Files] entry, so leave it alone.
